Feb. 11 - 2025 I have found Arch Linux very stable so far. The installation comes with known quirks, but their excellent documentation covers almost any question I have. I found out that the GNOME desktop environment is not that great, or at least it does not feel as snappy as the KDE desktop.</description></item><item><title>daBits and Domain Conversion in MP-SPDZ</title><link>http://hdvanegasm.github.io/posts/dabits_and_domain_conversion/dabits/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://hdvanegasm.github.io/posts/dabits_and_domain_conversion/dabits/</guid><description>In secure multi-party computation (MPC), each protocol has an underlying domain of computation in which the secure operations are performed. Such domains of computation are algebraic structures such as fields or rings. Some common examples for those domains are finite fields of order $q$, with $q$ prime, and rings of the form $\mathbb{Z}_{2^k}$. A special case is the field $\mathbb{Z}_2$, which is the one that we refer to as binary domain.</description></item></channel></rss>
