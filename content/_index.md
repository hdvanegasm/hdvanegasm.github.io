{{< /rawhtml>}}

My name is Hernán Darío Vanegas Madrigal. I have a Bachelor's degree
in Computer Engineering and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. I'm 
currently an MSc. student in Applied Mathematics at National 
University of Colombia. I am interested in cryptography and 
algorithm analysis. In general, I am interested in applying 
abstract mathematic concepts to computer science areas.

I am currently learning secure multi-party computation and its 
applications to machine learning.

At this moment, I am studing how to compute some genomic algorithms
privately using multi-party computation (MPC) protocols based on secret sharing 
(SS). This study includes the evaluation of the pros/cons and the efficiency of
these implementations. I am mainly using the [MP-SPDZ framework](https://github.com/data61/MP-SPDZ)
for this work.

# Interests

The following list shows my main interests but I'm open to work in
other affine areas related to them.
- Cryptography
- Secure multi-party computation (MPC)
- Machine learning
- Algorithm design and analysis
- Programming (Python, Rust)
