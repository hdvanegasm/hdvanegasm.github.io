This write-up is a rolling blog post about my experience with Arch Linux. This content may help somebody learn.

# Feb. 11 - 2025

I have found Arch Linux very stable so far. The installation comes with known quirks, but their excellent documentation covers almost any question I have. I found out that the GNOME desktop environment is not that great, or at least it does not feel as snappy as the KDE desktop. Hence, I chose KDE as my main desktop environment. 

The only problem I have faced so far is that Visual Studio Code has a minimal delay while writing. I don't know why that happens, but once I find a fix, I will post it here. The delay does not bother me a lot because it's very small.
